Small python repo to gather data from the OSbuddy API

OSbuddy is a third party app / game launcher for MMORPG runescape and it collects
user data about items being bought and sold on the games market place.

The info gathered from the summary.json is printed and sorted by volume and buy/sell prices 
seeing which items are worth stocking up on and selling.
